Investigating the Attention Layer of Image Captioning Deep Learning Models

This is the code attached to my bachelor thesis in computer science at the University of Bonn, titled "Investigating the Role of Attention Layersin Novel Object Image Captioning Modelsand Methods to Improve Them". The code is based on the [UpDown](https://github.com/nocaps-org/updown-baseline) model. All installation and training instructions are the same from the UpDown repostitory.

It is modified to adapt to the expirements mentioned in the thesis, with each expirement in its own branch.

### Abstract:

Where the fields of computer vision and natural language processing intersect, liesthe  highly  useful  and  interesting  application  of  Image  Captioning.   Over  the  lastdecade, there has been some major advancements in the ability to generate textualdescriptions of images, which are used to help the visually impaired use the variousplatforms, that have integrated themselves in our lives, as well as to help computersunderstand visual content better.  While existing models achieve high performancein describing objects they have seen before, many problems still arise when tryingto generate captions for objects never seen before.
This Thesis investigates one component of the UpDown Model described in [4](https://openaccess.thecvf.com/content_cvpr_2018/papers/Anderson_Bottom-Up_and_Top-Down_CVPR_2018_paper.pdf),namely the attention component. We try to measure the significance of its role, and to improve on it by providing more methods to incorporate visual informationin choosing what items to focus on in the image, to generate a viable captio
